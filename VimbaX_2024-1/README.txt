Install the transport layers
----------------------------
To install the transport layers provided with Vimba X, 
go to [InstallDir]/cti/and run (as needed, using sudo) Install_GenTL_Path.sh.

To uninstall the transport layers, call (as needed, using sudo) Uninstall_GenTL_Path.sh.

Third-party transport layers
----------------------------
VmbC.xml is located in [InstallDir]/bin.
It handles the usage of third-party transport layers that are not provided with Vimba X.

By default, transport layers from SVS (USB), (Coaxpress) and NET GmbH are loaded
for usage with Vimba X (if installed). 

Please note that this is an untested preview. 
To change loading of third-party transport layers, change VmbC.xml.
